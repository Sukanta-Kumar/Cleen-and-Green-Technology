## Overall Learning 

During this internship and course period, I gained a strong understanding of
problem-solving using **DSA in Java** and its importance in writing efficient and optimized code.

Along with this, I applied my technical knowledge while working on a real-world
full stack project called **Clean and Green Technology**.
I learned how frontend and backend systems communicate using **REST APIs**
and how data is stored and managed using **MySQL**.

I worked with **React** for building user-friendly interfaces and **Spring Boot**
for handling backend logic such as authentication, reward calculation,
order processing, and database operations.

This learning experience improved my ability to analyze requirements,
design modular solutions, work in a team environment,
and confidently explain technical concepts.
Overall, this internship helped me grow both technically and professionally.



<h2 style="color:#333;"> Projects Completed </h2>
<div align="left" style="margin: 20px; font-size: 16px;">

<p><strong><a href="#project1">Project 1:</a></strong> Clean and Green Technology </p>


</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Clean and Green Technology </h3>
<p>
  Clean and Green Technology is a web-based application designed to address the problem of plastic waste pollution
by encouraging citizen participation through a reward-based system.

The project connects citizens, municipalities, and environmental sustainability using a digital platform.
Users are motivated to contribute towards cleanliness by earning **Green Coins** for responsible actions,
which can later be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards like plants and compost.

The application includes modules such as user authentication,
earning and managing Green Coins,
an eco-friendly marketplace,
educational content on sustainability,
and order management.

The Report Waste module is a core part of the system design,
which enables structured waste reporting
and forms the foundation for the reward-based workflow.

This project helped me understand real-world application development,
full stack architecture, API-based communication, and practical problem-solving
while building a socially impactful solution.
